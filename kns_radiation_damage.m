% calculate radiation damage

Damage from each nuclide in decay chain.
Requires
E - energy of each nuclide's decay
how much damage that energy causes (Kinchin-Pease)
assume no damage heals, and no ion channeling
assume none of the damaging radiation escapes the sample (obviously not true)
A - activity of each nuclide
conc - how much of each nuclide there is in the sample
Î» - decay constants for each member of decay chain

assume pure Th-228 at t=0 with no other radioisotopes
sample made at t=2.5 years
assume all members of decay chain were incorporated into sample


% Start with activity of each species
% Neglect gammas and betas
% Input energy of alpha and daughter of each species
% Calculate damage from alpha, and then calculate damage from daughter
% Alpha:
% Imagine PbS bombarded by alphas
