<h1>About the LaTeX thesis templates</h1>
<p>The thesis templates have been created to make it easy to prepare
  your thesis using LaTeX while adhering to the MIT Thesis
  Specifications.  We make every effort to keep these up to date, but
  you should always consult
  the <a href="http://libraries.mit.edu/archives/thesis-specs/">MIT
  Libraries Thesis Specifications</a> before submitting your thesis.  If
  you notice something in the Thesis Specifications that does not match
  the templates, please let us know by e-mailing us at <tt>thesis</tt>
  AT <tt>mit</tt> DOT <tt>edu</tt>.</p>

<p>The thesis templates are highly customizable, and there are many
  options and macros available for your use.  Most of these are
  documented in the comments in each file, especially <tt>main.tex</tt>.
  You are encouraged to read through the comments.</p>

<h2>Downloading</h2>

<p>You may download the thesis templates
